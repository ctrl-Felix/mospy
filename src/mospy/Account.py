    The account class can be instantiated through a seed or a private key. If nothing is provided it will create a new keyring and the params to work with the cosmos chain

    Note:
        * You can't provide a ``seed_phrase`` and a``private_key``
        * A ``readble`` method behaves is the getter for a Attribute (Example: ``hrp = account.hrp``)
        * A ``writable`` method is the setter for the Attribute (Example: ``account.hrp = "cosmos"``)
        * A method can be setter and getter at the same time. The Parameters description always refers to the setter while the Returns section belongs to the getter
